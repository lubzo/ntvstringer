PHP FFMPEG Example
-----------------------------------

**PHP FFMPEG Example** is a PHP test-case written for a tutorial at [MyOwnHomeServer.com](http://myownhomeserver.com "MyOwnHomeServer.com").

It serves as an example of how to create your own PHP script with status/progress update polling via AJAX and executing FFMPEG on the server to convert your video.

How It Works
------------------

This was written to be ran on a Windows Apache/PHP server, such as XAMPP.

You'll first need to make some minor changes in **config.php**, mainly setting the **FFMPEG_PATH** constant to the correct location for your Windows computer.

Add a video file to your source folder, then you should be able to visit index.php from your web browser and run the conversion test.

A sample video can be downloaded from [http://wp.me/a1Xgia-3W](http://wp.me/a1Xgia-3W "Sample video file download") if you don't have one to test with.

Please post any questions there and if you have any script issues that aren't configuration-related, please post them in the Issues section on GitHub.  Thanks!
